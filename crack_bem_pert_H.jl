# The function makes the simulation of Boundary Element Method (BEM)
# for a fault in a material
# It will calculates the stress and vector properties of the fault
# which will be used to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the faults

# Flow of the function:
# Calculate the midpoints and segment lengths
# Define patch properties such as the dimensions, strike-dip orientation
# normal, strike-slip, and dip-slip vectors
# Group all of the properties to a matrix
# Use the matrix for Green's functions and stress calculation
using LinearAlgebra
